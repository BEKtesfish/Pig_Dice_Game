Welcome to the Pig Dice game!

## Introduction

Pig Dice is a simple dice game where players compete to be the first to reach a target score. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points with each roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach the target score wins the game.

# Rules of the agme.

        Pig Dice Game Rules:

        Objective:
        The objective of Pig Dice is to be the first player to reach or exceed a total score of 100 points.

        Equipment:
        - One six-sided dice
        - A scorecard or a way to keep track of points

        Gameplay:
        1. Starting the Game:
        - The game begins with two players, taking turns to roll the dice.
        - Players can choose to play in single-player mode against the computer or in multiplayer mode against another
            player.
        - Note: Type 'start' and follow the instruction.

        2. Taking Turns:
        - On a player's turn, they roll the dice.
        - If the player rolls:
            - roll 1: They lose all points accumulated during that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
            - Any other number: The number rolled is added to the player's turn total, and they can choose to hold or 
            roll again.

        3. Holding:
        - If a player chooses to hold, the turn total is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's
            turn.
        - Holding allows the player to secure their points for that turn and add them to their total score.

        4. Winning the Game:
        - The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds a total score of 100 points.
        - Once a player reaches the winning score, they are declared the winner, and the game ends.

        5. Cheat Mode:
        - Optionally, players can enable cheat mode where the dice always roll a six. This can be used for testing or
            fun purposes but should be disabled during regular gameplay.
        - Note: Type 'cheat' and press Enter to activate cheat mode and start the game.

        6. High Score:
        - Players have the option to see the high score.
        - Note: Type 'high_score' or 'score'.

        7. Difficulty Levels:
        - Players can choose from different difficulty levels when playing against the computer, such as Easy, Medium, 
        or Hard. Each difficulty level may alter the computer's strategy or behavior.

        8. Exit:
        - While playing, type 'exit' to terminate and restart the game.

        These are the basic rules of the Pig Dice game. Enjoy playing!
