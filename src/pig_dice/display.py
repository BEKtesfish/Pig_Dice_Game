Pig Dice Game Rules:

Objective:
The objective of Pig Dice is to be the first player to reach or exceed a total score of 100 points.

Equipment:
- One six-sided dice
- A scorecard or a way to keep track of points

Gameplay:
1. Starting the Game:
   - The game begins with two players, taking turns to roll the dice.
   - Players can choose to play in single-player mode against the computer or in multiplayer mode against another
     player.
   - Note: Type 'start' and follow the instruction.

2. Taking Turns:
   - On a player's turn, they roll the dice.
   - If the player rolls:
     - roll 1: They lose all points accumulated during that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
     - Any other number: The number rolled is added to the player's turn total, and they can choose to hold or 
     roll again.

3. Holding:
   - If a player chooses to hold, the turn total is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's
     turn.
   - Holding allows the player to secure their points for that turn and add them to their total score.

4. Winning the Game:
   - The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds a total score of 100 points.
   - Once a player reaches the winning score, they are declared the winner, and the game ends.

5. Cheat Mode:
   - Optionally, players can enable cheat mode where the dice always roll a six. This can be used for testing or
     fun purposes but should be disabled during regular gameplay.
   - Note: Type 'cheat' and press Enter to activate cheat mode and start the game.

6. High Score:
   - Players have the option to see the high score.
   - Note: Type 'high_score' or 'score'.

7. Difficulty Levels:
   - Players can choose from different difficulty levels when playing against the computer, such as Easy, Medium, 
   or Hard. Each difficulty level may alter the computer's strategy or behavior.

8. Exit:
   - While playing, type 'exit' to terminate and restart the game.

These are the basic rules of the Pig Dice game. Enjoy playing!
